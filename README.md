This console application took me to create close to 1.5hours.
I would probably be able to reduce some of the IF statements by refactoring code a bit. Have not added to many comments as I believe code is self explanatory. 
Additionally, there is almost no validation. Also, I have not added dependency injection which is crutial for any application.
I felt a bit rushed for this task, because of time limitations. Did not have much time to think if there is any better solution.
